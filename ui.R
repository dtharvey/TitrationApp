                    brief introduction to acid-base titrimetry, often 
                    in the context of a laboratory experiment in which you
                    determine the concentration of one species, which
                    we call the analyte, by determining the amount of 
                    a second species, which we call the titrant, that
                    reacts stoichiometrically with the analyte. The 
                    titrant is added, using a buret, to a solution that 
                    contains the analyte, and the volume of titrant 
                    needed to reach the stoichiometric equivalence point 
                    is determined using a visual indicator whose change 
                    in color signals the titration's end point; if all 
                    is well, the difference between the experimental 
                    end point and the theoretical equivalence point is 
                    sufficiently small that it does not affect the 
                    accuracy of the analysis. Because we know the 
                    concentration and volume of titrant, we can determine
                    the moles of analyte in the original sample. In this
